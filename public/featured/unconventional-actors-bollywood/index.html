                    <p>The last few years of Bollywood have given us unconventional movies, which incorporated unconventional actors, who have hereby successfully proved that it’s not all about the songs, the dance or the good looks; it only comes down to the most basic reason for the existence of cinema - the art of acting and entertainment.</p>

<p>This can certainly be termed as a revolution of quality actors and quality entertainment in Bollywood, or as we like to call it &ldquo;adieu massy, Salman Khan movies&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here are our top favourite unconventional stars that we happen to be obsessed with off late.</p>

<h3>Rajkumar Rao</h3>

<p>After starring in several critically acclaimed films like Love Sex Aur Dhoka, Gangs of Wasseypur and Shahid, Rajkumar Rao started to get recognised as an all-round performer. He aced comedy as well as mastered drama and negative roles. Queen was his initial breakthrough into conventional cinema that caught everyone&rsquo;s attention. He fit that Delhi-boy patriarchal character so well, all the women who saw the film hated his guts by the end(because that’s how awesome his portrayal was!). Newton came next as an offbeat drama that elevated his stardom yet again. Bareilly Ki Barfi proved to be one of his most exciting performances, where he switched from one personality to another with such ease, it was hilarious and breathtaking! Lastly, Stree gave us goosebumps and giggles at the same go and created a genre that Bollywood has never experimented with before.</p>

<p>For all you Rajkumar Rao fans, the good news is, this is only the beginning! He already has two big films lined up at the beginning of 2019, a romantic drama called Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga opposite Sonam Kapoor and a dark comedy called Mental Hai Kya? opposite Kangana Ranaut.</p>

<h3>Ayushmann Khurrana</h3>

<p>His first job was that of a radio jockey, he then won the reality show Roadies and went on to become a TV anchor, slowly paving his way into Bollywood with a debut in Vicky Donor. That small budget entertainer was an overnight blockbuster and there was no going back for Khurrana. Apart from his acting, he was recognised for his singing too. Then came a few misses but he soon regained balance with a YRF blockbuster called Dum Laga Ke Haisha. He was a much mature performer by now and picked his scripts with care. Our next favourite was Bareilly Ki Barfi, a light-hearted romantic comedy that stole our hearts. Shubh Mangal Savdhan came after that with a social message and a hilarious take on the same; which made us realise Ayushmann is not afraid to make his work stand out as a conversation starter. Talking of his recent releases, Andhadhun left us spellbound with its dark humour and lastly, Badhaai Ho was a funny family movie too.</p>

<p>With great passion and a good eye for his scripts, Ayushmann proves to be a promising star who’s here to stay! Apparently, his next is a romantic comedy called Googly opposite Nushrat Bharucha and there are a couple of other projects we’ll know of soon, so stay tuned.</p>

<h3>Vicky Kaushal</h3>

<p>The man who pursued an engineering degree in technology realised his passion for acting and started off as a basic struggler in this industry six years ago. He now has Amitabh Bachchan’s handwritten letter of appreciation for his acting and some major blockbusters under his pocket. In 2015, a story of four ill-fated people from the land of Ganges - Masaan, caught our attention with exemplary performances and a heartbreaking story. Vicky scored his grand entry into Bollywood just then and also a fancy film called Bombay Velvet. This one was certainly a major miss, but Netflix then came barging in with eccentric and interesting movies like Love Per Square Foot and Lust Stories, that turned out to be great entertainers for millennials and metropolitan masses. Next was Vicky’s immaculate presence in Raazi that thrived at the box office and turned him into a true Btown celebrity for starring opposite Alia Bhatt. Then came the big-budget biopic wherein his characterisation of Sanjay Dutt’s best friend was heartwarming and downright fabulous! Lastly, in Manmarziyan he played an irresponsible and immature adult and made that character his own. Which makes us wonder if this amazing actor is only 10 films old!</p>

<p>Vicky Kaushal is now a household name and his grasp of every character never fails to surprise us. His next film Uri based on the Uri Attack will release in January 2019 and he has been signed for Karan Johar’s dream project Takht along with various other big stars, set to release in May 2020.</p>

<p>The future is shiny bright for these unconventional protagonists, don’t you agree? We need these three to star in more movies and turn the definition of &ldquo;quintessential Bollywood&rdquo; upside down.</p>
