                    <p>In a country where any physiological disorder or mental illness is looked down upon, it takes a lot to open up about it, that too on a public platform. But these heroes stepped up just for the sake of normalising these issues so that people can take heed and understand it in the first place.</p>

<p>You’ll be surprised to know the following names. Ready?</p>

<h3>Shahrukh Khan</h3>

<p>In 2008, Shahrukh suffered a major injury on his right shoulder, but ignorance made the pain worse, and he finally had to undergo a minimally invasive surgery in 2010. This led the superstar to relax at home and stay away from his work but it caused anxiety. Post the surgery, Shahrukh revealed it all and said that the shoulder injury and the suffering caused depression but he was finally out of it. Also, that he felt happy and boosted with energy.</p>

<p>Charmer as always, you give us hope SRK. &lt;3</p>

<h3>Manisha Koirala</h3>

<p>The beautiful Manisha Koirala has been through some rough patches in the past like marital discord and a subsequent battle with cancer. This, in turn, left the actor wallowing in the depths of depression. But she sought out clinical help, spoke about it widely and starred in a movie called “Dear Maya” last year that briefly touched the topic of depression.</p>

<p>Awesome, isn’t she?</p>

<h3>Deepika Padukone</h3>

<p>Deepika is idolised by many in India and across the globe for her beauty, elegance, and charisma. She had it all when an apparent heartbreak caused her to go through depression. But she didn’t keep it under wraps and admitted that she’d frequently break down and found it hard to concentrate. Eventually, she found her way out of the puddle once she received help and care. This made her realise the importance of mental health awareness and she established ‘Live Love Laugh’ for the cause.</p>

<p>You go, girl!</p>

<h3>Anushka Sharma</h3>

<p>Anushka Sharma is known for her politically right statements and witty replies. She tries to hide away from the paparazzi but never holds back when she wants to voice her opinions. This one time she put up a quote on Twitter related to depression/anxiety and the Twitterati didn’t take it well. This is how she responded:
“I have anxiety. And I&rsquo;m treating my anxiety. I&rsquo;m on medication for my anxiety. Why am I saying this? Because it’s a completely normal thing. It&rsquo;s a biological problem. In my family, there have been cases of depression. More and more people should talk openly about it. There is nothing shameful about it or something to hide. If you had a constant stomach pain, wouldn’t you go to the doctor? It’s that simple. I want to make this my mission, to take any shame out of this, to educate people about this.”</p>

<p>You’re a class act, Anushka!</p>

<h3>Varun Dhawan</h3>

<p>Varun Dhawan is the star of the moment. We love his commitment to acting off late and he has impressed us in every way possible. Known for his fun-loving banter, you’d not imagine him to have ever faced depression but he revealed otherwise. While shooting the movie, Badlapur he admitted to being partially depressed.
“..I was not clinically declared depressed but I was heading there. I was very sad to a certain degree. I don&rsquo;t want to use the term &lsquo;depression&rsquo; loosely because it&rsquo;s a serious illness. It definitely affected my mental health. I was prescribed and did see a doctor for it as well.”</p>

<p>Thank you, Dhawan. You give us hope!</p>

<p>We’ve been assured by the biggies, now let’s treat it and beat it instead of brushing it under the rug.</p>
