We are in complete awe!

Hands down, she has one of the best celeb accounts on Instagram and it slightly reminds us of Jennifer Garner’s feed. The realistic traits and humour on both their pages are almost identical, which makes us wonder if they’d make great friends in real life, and discuss their insta-posts if they ever met. We all love Hollywood and Bollywood collabs, don’t we?

More power to you, Sush!
