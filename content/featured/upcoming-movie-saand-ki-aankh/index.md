After being thoroughly successful at making crime dramas like Gangs of Wasseypur and Sacred Games, Anurag Kashyap is back with yet another offbeat film called Saand Ki Aankh starring Taapsee Pannu and Bhumi Pednekar. Inspired by true events, this eccentric movie will be directed by Tushar Hiranandani.

These badass women are going to play two real-life badass 60-somethings who happen to be sharpshooters. Chandro and Prakashi Tomar from Uttar Pradesh are famously known as “shooter-dadis”. These two ace shooters have individually won more than 350 medals in state and national championships, all while raising 30 children and 45 grandchildren. They’re basically real-life superwomen and their story must be worth beholding!

At the wrap-up-party of Saand Ki Aankh Bhumi proudly said, “Yes, it was definitely challenging to play this part but more than that it was a responsibility to portray them.”

After the poster for this film was released, the ageing and wrinkled looks of the actors created a buzz and received mixed reviews on the internet, but that’s just how the internet is - judging and critical. They apparently trolled the makers for casting young actors to play 60-year-olds, to which Taapsee said, ”Nobody has a problem when I, a 30-year-old, play a college girl’s role or even when 50-year-old actors play college-goers, but somehow when we play older people, there’s a problem.” But when the trolling raised this question, the makers told her that, “A lot of actors closer to that age group had refused to do the film.” Kudos to Taapsee for handling the paparazzi like a pro!

According to Pinkvilla, apart from these two promising actors, another interesting cast member that is making news is Aamir Khan’s sister Nikat Khan who will be debuting in the film. Sources say she will be playing a significant role of a Maharani in the film and the makers knew that she was best suited for the role almost immediately.

We’re truly awaiting this badass movie! More power to such powerful women and their powerful stories.
