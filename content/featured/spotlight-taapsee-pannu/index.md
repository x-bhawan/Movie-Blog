The loud-heart, the feisty and the ever-empowered Taapsee Pannu has won our hearts with her fierce roles and fearless persona. She has an unabashed humour and a desi vibe that makes us want to watch every movie she’s ever done, be it a Hindi, Tamil or Telugu movie!

Not many are aware that she started her journey as an actor in a Telugu film Jhummandi Nadam in 2010 and later starred in Tamil films, one of which (Aadukalam) won six National Awards in 2011. Well, wow. After creating a stir in the South she stepped into Bollywood around 2013 and slowly stunned us with her great performance in movies like Baby, Pink, Naam Shabana, Judwaa 2, Soorma and more recently, Manmarziyan.

This Delhi-girl is a tough Leo who lives in the moment and has no regrets. If you adore her just as much as we do, here are a few of her statements that will give you a sneak peek into who Taapsee is!

<blockquote>“I’m so outspoken because I don’t have a surname to protect”</blockquote>

In a recent event in Lucknow, Taapsee spoke her heart out about being a walking-talking #nofilter because she basically doesn’t have a “surname to protect”. Love the honesty, T!

<blockquote>“I love adventure sports.”</blockquote>

Taapsee told HT that her idea of a perfect day is going skydiving or snorkelling because she loves adventure sports! We’re not surprised one bit, she truly seems like an adrenaline junkie!

<blockquote>“You can make me work for 14 hours at a stretch, but don’t make me sit.”</blockquote>

Vivacious and spontaneous, Taapsee hates to wait around on a film set for her scene to get ready, she rather works long hours, she told HT. She’s apparently done in a take or two, once she catches the right vibe. How impressive!

<blockquote>The most attractive quality in a man is being “a self-made person”</blockquote>

Taapsee finds self-made men very attractive and all we can think of is her longtime love interest Mathias Boe, who’s a Danish shuttler. When asked about her thoughts on marriage she revealed that she’ll get married when she’s ready to have a kid. Besides, she believes that if you’re really in love with someone or you enjoy spending time with them, you don’t have to be married. We second that.

<blockquote>“I can message him(Amitabh Bachchan) anytime and he also messages me.”</blockquote>

After sharing the big screen with Amitji in Pink, Taapsee told HT that she’s like his buddy now and often texts him. They both have worked on an upcoming project called Badla as well and share a great rapport. How cool is she?!

<blockquote>I’m in a “happy space as far as film offers are concerned”</blockquote>

Taapsee Pannu said that she is being offered appealing and interesting roles that are drastically different from one another, so she is in a ‘happy space as far as film offers are concerned’

Currently working on her second film with Amitabh Bachchan called Badla, Taapsee’s had a fulfilling and promising career so far, and we just can’t wait to see what this powerhouse has in store for us!
