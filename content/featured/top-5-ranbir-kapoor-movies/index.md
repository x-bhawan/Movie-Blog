The Kapoor prince who is otherwise known to love aloofness celebrated his birthday eve with a chill celebrity bash at his place in Bandra. Is this Alia Bhatt’s effect on the actor? Probably.

We say so because apart from Karan Johar, the guest list at this party was rather surprising. But that’s definitely a happy picture. Shahrukh looks adorable as ever and Ranveer looks excited as ever. No wonder KJo called it the biggest blockbuster ever!

Speaking of which, Ranbir Kapoor has time and again proven his acting proficiency and given us a number of blockbuster hits in the last 10 years of his shining career. We list a few that won our hearts.

<h3>Rockstar</h3>
We see Imtiaz Ali’s Rockstar bring out one of the best sides of Ranbir Kapoor as an actor. He plays a singer who is desperate to make it big and wishes to seek inspiration through a heartbreak. Unfortunately, it does lead him to stardom, but along with self-destruction.

The emotions portrayed by the actor in this film are indescribable in words. He darts into a reckless teenager’s character just as impeccably as he transforms himself into an insanely angry and expressive musician. An act that deserves an Oscar? Hell yes.

<h3>Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani</h3>
When a charmer like Ranbir Kapoor tries his hand at slapstick, it is a spectacle of pure joy. This one’s a romantic comedy where the boy meets girl and tries to impress her with clumsy dance moves and madcap gestures. The movie is almost a comic book brought to life; it’s full of colour, loud emotions and naive love.

Katrina and Ranbir hit it off quite well in the film and rumours have it that this is exactly when the two actors got romantically involved in real life. So if you’re looking for an eccentric romantic comedy that came to life, <a href="https://spuul.com/videos/16899-ajab-prem-ki-ghazab-kahani" rel="noopener">stream this one right away</a>.

<h3>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</h3>
A go-getter and travel-lover has planned it all and achieves every goal with his hard work and passion. YJHD is almost like a new-gen DDLJ, it didn’t have a grumpy father or a villain but the only thing that stood between a happy ending was a choice that Ranbir’s character, Bunny had to make. Relatable much?

We see Ranbir in an easy-going mood through the course of this film, almost like he’s playing himself. This Dharma drama is sure to bring a smile to your face on a gloomy day.

<h3>Barfi</h3>
The light-hearted yet passionate and innocent charm of this film resonates with the aura of Chaplin. The ardent love that Ranbir’s character emotes without saying a word will leave you in complete awe.

While it’s not exactly a comedy, it’s a blissful experience. Child-like humour is the true spark of this film and it’s animated characters are brilliantly portrayed by Priyanka Chopra and Ranbir Kapoor. Barfi is a movie that will stay with you forever.

<h3>Sanju</h3>
The mysteries of Sanjay Dutt’s life unfold in this biopic where Ranbir Kapoor aces the “many lives” of Dutt, drawing a chaotic picture of the extremes the actor’s life.

From being a drug addict to losing his mother, going through a nasty breakup and being wrapped into the underworld of controversy and finally going behind the bars – is this the same man we’re talking about? As a matter of fact, yes. We see Ranbir go beyond the bar and fit himself in Sanju’s shoes, making us wonder if we’re watching Sanjay Dutt star in his own biopic.


Through the years we've seen Ranbir create method and mayhem on the big screen, giving us hope in Indian cinema and winning our hearts at the same go. This megastar can surely be termed as a veteran now if not more.

Here’s to many more years of brilliant Ranbir Kapoor movies!
